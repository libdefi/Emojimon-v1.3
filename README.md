# Emojimon v1.3

Emojimon is a very friendly tutorial for new MUD users. I thought it would be nice to make Emojimon more interesting, so I implemented Emojimon v1.3. v2.0 was not made because it is not yet ready to be fully interesting, and I promise to update it to v2.0 when I do that.

In the tutorial, the background was a meadow, but this time we will use a snowy mountain as the theme.


## Issue.
Difficult to see the experience of success or failure to the user as in a traditional game.


### Solution (what I implemented)
- Set up game start and goal.
- If the goal is achieved, the user should be rewarded with ERC721.
- After reaching a goal, there is a reset button and the game can be restarted


### Future ToDo

[Introduce the concept of "game over" by battles.]
- Implement "HP" for users and monsters.
- Allow monsters to attack the user.
- Implement "speed" of user and monster, so that the faster user can attack first.
- Implement "game over" when the user's HP reaches 0

[Originalization of NFT]
- Complete NFT on-chain and generate images based on user behavior data
